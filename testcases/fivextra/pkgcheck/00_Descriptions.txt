pkgcheck

	This is used to check that a package (named on the command line) is
	installed properly. It uses rpm -V to do this. Since some packages
	have files that might legitimately be changed after installation,
	pkgcheck.sh honors "skip lists" which are lists of files to be
	ignored. These are placed in files named after the package and given
	a ".skip" extension. For exampls the package aaa_base includes the
	file /etc/ld.so.conf which might get changed. To account for this
	there is a file called aaa_base.skip which contains the name of the
	file. There is also a file named pkgcheck.skip wich is honored for
	all packages. In any of these files, any regular expression
	recognixed by grep can be used to identify files.
