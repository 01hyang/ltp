tftp  
	Test the functionality of tftp and tftpd.

usage:
        ./tftp_test.sh [-r host] [-h]

        ./tftp_test.sh  -r : Set the remote tftp server. If not set, will use localhost.
        ./tftp_test.sh  -h : Print this help text.

Note:
	This test can use tftp server on localhost or on a remote machine.
	When use tftp server on localhost, there are four tests : ascii/binary mode of put and ascii/binary mode of get.
	When use a remote tftp server, there is only two tests : ascii/binary mode of get. And you should do some preparations:
	1) Copy the two data file test.bin and test.txt in tftp-data directory to the tftp server's root directory on remote host.
	2)Correctly start the tftp server, standalone mode or from inetd/xinetd.
