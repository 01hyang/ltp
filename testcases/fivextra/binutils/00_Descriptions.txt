    How to use this case 

    1.   run "./binutils.sh"    



    NOTE:

       1. Command "gcc" is needed by this testsuite as this is a MCP DevKit package. 

       2. Command "as" is tested in every function, 
	  command "ld" is used by command "gcc",
	  and command "gprof" is tested when run glibc_profile's testcase.
