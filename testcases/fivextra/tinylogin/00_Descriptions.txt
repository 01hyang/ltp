tinylogin.sh

	Tests tinylogin. The test can be configured to test the specific
	tinylogin utilities supported by the build. This is done by copying
	the file "tinylogin.links" from the  source directory to the
	tinylogin testcase directory (here). "tinylogin.links is generated 
	with make in tinylogin source directory, i.e. .../tinylogin-*.**/make.  
	
	"Make all" in the testcase directory will modify the executable to 
	only test the supported utilities.
