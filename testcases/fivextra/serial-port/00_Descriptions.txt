serial-port

	Test data xfer on serial port. THIS IS JUST A PROOF OF CONCEPT SO
	FAR! NEEDS TO BE TURNED INTO A REAL TESTCASE.

	To run this, set up a serial link between two serial ports. These
	may be on the same system. The cable needs to be a "null modem"
	cable. Start serial-sever.sh and then serial-client.sh. Once
	serial-server.sh is running it will keep ruining until canceled.
	This can be done with Ctrl-C. serial-client runs once than quites.
	It can be started over again.

	TODO: Need to detemine the serial port settings used by the end
	customer and try to work with those.
