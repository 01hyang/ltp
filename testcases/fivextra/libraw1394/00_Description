IBM CSDL testsuite for libraw1394
------------------------------------
Refer to the sourcecode, CSDL add this libraw1394.sh to
test the libraw1394 
  libraw1394 is the only supported interface to the kernel side raw1394 of the Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to the connected 1394 buses to user space.  Through libraw1394/raw1394, applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes without requiring a kernel driver for the
protocol in question.

Before run the dmidecode_test.sh:
1. Be root user
2. already install the libraw1394 package, include command "testlibraw"
