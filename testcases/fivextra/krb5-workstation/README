DESCRIPTION
This testcase "krb5-workstation" work with testcase "krb5-server" to test
kerberos services and application, you should start the case "krb5-server"
at first, and then run "krb5-workstation" to test package krb5-workstation.

"krb5-server" testcase could run seperately without "krb5-workstation",
however, "krb5-workstation" case couldn't run properly without "krb5-server"
running to provide KDC and AS services.

REQUIREMENTS

You need to have your network set up and dns server in test domain runs 
properly, and had better use ntp(Network Time Proposal) to synchronize 
your test machines.

On KDC server side, you should install krb5-libs, krb5-workstation and 
krb5-server packages; on kerberos application side, you should install 
install krb5-libs, krb5-workstation packages. You could use KDC server
machine as you client of course.

TESTCASE DESCRIPTION

There are two shell script testcase to test kerberos packages krb5-libs, 
krb5-workstation and krb5-server. As you know, use krb5-workstation.sh to
test krb5-workstation package, and use krb5-server.sh to test krb5-server
package, and krb5-libs was called during server and client testcases's
running period.

You could run the tow both testcases in the same machine, as well as you
could run then in server/client mode.

RUN TEST

(1)kdc side: start kdc testcase at first
	command>./krb5-server.sh <enter>

(2)kdc side: wait a moment to backup original kerberos service, and then
             create a new one, start kdc and kadmin service later, if the
             case runs correctly, it will promp a message bellow, remember
             dont's quit if you do not really want to quit especially you
             want to test client side, quit will stop kdc and kadmin service

	output>

	krb5-server.sh    1  PASS  :  0: tc_local_setup

	krb5-server.sh    4  PASS  :  4: start kadmin
	input command "quit" to quit
	<wait inputting...>

(3)app side: after you run krb5-server.sh properlly, you could start workstation
             testcase, you should specify the kdc machine name in the command line

	command>./krb5-workstation.sh kdc_servername <enter>

note: the argument kdc_servername must be the kerberos KDC name, and provide kdc
      service now!
      if kdc_servername not specified, the case regard local machine as the kdc
      server.

(4)app side: wait a moment to test kerberos application, here's the successful output

	Starting INET services. (xinetd)                                     done

(5)kdc side: after you finish your workstation testcase, you could stop server
             test now, simply input "quit" to continue and exit
	output>
	input command "quit" to quit
	quit <enter>
	output>

	ksu client failed, and failed manual test too!
