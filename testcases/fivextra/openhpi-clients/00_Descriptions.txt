openhpi-clients_test.sh: FIV testcase for openhpi-clients

	This is not HPI implementation API compliance test, it's a basic test for client tools, 
	e.g. hpifan, hpievent ..
	currently only dummy plugin is tested. 

   make sure you have the following settings in your /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf: (enabled by default)
	plugin libdummy
	handler libdummy {
		entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}"
		name = "test"
		addr =  0
	}   
      

Note: you can enable watchdog plugin as well:

1. add the following in openhpi.conf    
	plugin libwatchdog0
	handler        libwatchdog {
		name = "0"
		addr = "/dev/watchdog"
		entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,0}"
	}

2.	Load softdog module by:
		insmod watchdog soft_noboot=1 # for test purpose

3.	the test script is the same as for dummy plugin.


Note:  ipmi and directipmi plugin fails due to the lack of device support for /dev/ipmi0
