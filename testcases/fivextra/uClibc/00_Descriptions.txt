    How to use this case 


     1.   After typing command "make" ,you can use command "make install" to install it, or type "./uclibc.sh" to run it 

          directly.


     NOTE:

          1. This case didn't compile the c sourcecode when you type "make install". You must type "make" and "make install"

             when you want compile the code and install it.

          2. The Makefile under the top-level directory of this test case is inactive ,pls remove the "#" in front of 

             every command line before using it. 
         
          3. This testcase is for xf86, it should change Makefile under "uClibctest" directory in order to be used for other 

             platform.
