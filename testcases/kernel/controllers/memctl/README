TEST SUITE:

The directory memctl contains the tests related to memory controller.
More testcases are expected to be added in future.

TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to test memory controller functionality.

FILES DESCRIPTION:

memctl_testN.c
---------------
These are the tasks to run for memory controller testing.
The tasks have been automated in the sense that they can assign themselves
to the appropriate group, can migrate to another group etc.
Maximum effort has been put to reuse the code and keep total code size low.

myfunctions.sh
----------
This file contains the functions which are common for all the tests. For ex.
the setup and cleanup functions which do setup for running the test and do
cleanup once the test finishes. The setup() function creates /dev/memctl
directory, mounts cgroup filesystem on it with memory. It then creates
a number(n) of groups in /dev/memctl. The cleanup function does a complete
cleanup of the system.
(*However most of the error scenarios have been tested for a sane cleanup,
still if any time cleanup fails, just manually execute the commands written
in cleanup function. (Ensure you have not cd into any group in controller
dir tree which is a very common situation)

run_memctl_test.sh
------------------
This script creates different scenarios for memory controller testing and
fires (n) tasks in different groups to do some memory allocations etc. It
waits for the return status from tasks and reports test pass/fail accordingly.

Makefile
--------

The usual makefile for this directory

PASS/FAIL CRITERION:
==================
The test cases are intelligent enough in deciding the pass or failure of a
test.
