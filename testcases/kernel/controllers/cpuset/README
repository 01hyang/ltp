TEST SUITE:

The directory cpuset contains the tests related to the cpuset controller.

Cpuset is a mechanism for assigning a set of CPUs and Memory Nodes to a set of
tasks.

There are total 190 testcases taht have been added till date. Now, These
testcases contain the basis operation test and part functionality test of
cpuset, such as: adding/removing cpus/mems, setting flags, exclusive function,
hierarchy realtion, inherit relation and cpuset VS syscall.

More testcases will be added in future.

NOTE: the test can be run by root only. And 4 CPUs and 3 Memory Nodes is need
to run it at least.

TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to test the functionality of cpuset.

FILES DESCRIPTION:

cpuset_base_ops_test
--------------------
Directory containing the shell script which is used to test the basis
operation of cpuset. such as: adding/removing cpus/mems, setting flags.

cpuset_exclusive_test
---------------------
Directory containing the shell script which is used to test exclusive
function of cpuset.

cpuset_hierarchy_test
---------------------
Directory containing the shell script is used to test hierarchy relation
of cpuset.

cpuset_syscall_test
-------------------
Directory containing the shell script and program which are used to test
syscalls whether they collide with cpuset.

cpuset_lib
----------
This directory contains the library and script for cpuset controller testing.
such as: cpuset_funcs.sh(functions for cpuset test script)

run_cpuset_test.sh
------------------
This script runs all the 190 testcases.

Makefile
--------
Each directory in cpuset has its usual makefile, it is for its directory.
