THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CONTROLLERS) TEST PLAN

This directory "controllers" is created to include all test cases related to the resource
controllers in linux. The testplan at present includes testing of cpu controller and memory
controller. This is the first testcase in LTP to test the resource controllers (and tests
cpu controller only). Future testcases willl be included to test the cpu controller further
and memory controller. Each controller will have it's own directory to contain all test cases.


For more information on resource controllers please refer to cgroups.txt in kernel documentation.
