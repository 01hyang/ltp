THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CONTROLLERS) TEST PLAN

This directory "controllers" is created to include all test cases related to
the resource controllers in linux. The testplan at present includes testing
of cpu controller and memory controller.
At present the test cases are there to test cpu controller only. In future
testcases willl be included to test the cpu controller further and memory
controller. Each controller will have it's own directory to contain all test
cases.
A brief description of all the testcases is given in the corresponding
controllers directory.

CPU CONTROLLER:
==============

Test 01:

The aim of the test is to find any dependency of cpu controller on exact value
of shares to schedule the tasks. For example if there are two groups running
1 task each then they must get the cpu time in the same ratio irrespective of
the share values i.e. share ratios 1:2, 10:20, 100:200, 1000:2000 etc should
give the same cpu usage for each group.

For more information on resource controllers please refer to cgroups.txt in kernel documentation.
