direct_io
	These are a set of direct I/O tests created by Narasimha Sharoff 
	<nsharoff@us.ibm.com>.


disktest

        Does repeated accesses to a filespec and optionally writes to, reads 
	from, and  verifies  the  data.  By default, disktest makes assumptions
	about the running environment which allows for a quick start of IO 
	generation.  However, Disktest has  a  large  number  of command line 
	options which can be used to adapt the test for a variety of uses 
	including data integrity, medium integraty, performance, and simple 
	application simulation.


stress_cd

	Creates multiple read threads on the cdrom device.

stress_floppy

	Tests the reading/writing/formatting on a floppy drive.
