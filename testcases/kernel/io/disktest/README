Disktest Version v1.0.0

WHAT IS DISKTEST?

  Disktest does repeated accesses to a disk devices and filesystems and
  optionally writes to, reads from, and verifies the data.

  There are many optional parameters that can be supplied to disktest to have
  it perform in a multitude of test cases.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - See the LICENSE
  file that should have accompanied this distrobution for more details.

WHAT OS DOES IT RUN ON?

  This code has been written to compile on Linux, AIX, and Windows.  Both
  on a 32bit and 64bit environments.  There should be no compatability issues
  at the time of compliation or execution.

DOCUMENTATION:

  At present the only documentation that accompanies disktest is the man page
  which is included with the source files as disktest.1.  You can either
  install it as a man page on your system, use groff to view it of man is
  not available, or export the man page to another readable format such as
  html.

INSTALLING THE SOURCE:

  You can install the source my untaring the source files:
          gzip -cd disktest.<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  This will create a directroy in the current directory of:
          disktest.<version>
  The directory contents that should have been included in this package are:

          README     LICENSE      childmain.c  childmain.h
          defs.h     disktest.1   Getopt.c     Getopt.h
          globals.c  globals.h    main.c       main.h
          Makefile   parse.c      parse.h      sfunc.c
          sfunc.h    threading.c  threading.h  usage.c
          usage.h

BUILDING THE SOURCE

  You will need a compiler for the machine that you want to build the source
  for.  There is a mike file that is included which will use the default
  compiler for your system.

  If you wish, add the system type to the CFLAG line in the Makefile for the
  system that you are compileing the code for:
          Windows: -D"WIN32"
          AIX:     -D"_AIX"
          Linux:   -D"LINUX"  (Not needed as Linux is the default)
  This will setup the includes and the typedefs correctly to support the
  different system types.

  Issue the make command:
          "make all"
  The result should be a file in the source directory that is executable with
  'disktest' as the name.

  There are other make commands defined:
          "make clean"  Will clean out executables, temp files and archives
          "make distro" Will repackage the source files

EXECUTING

  To get started run distest with the -? flag:
          "disktest -?"
  This will display a simplified usage to get started.  More discriptive
  documentation is located in the manpage, along with examples of executions
  and output that can give you the first look and feel of how disktest will
  recive inputs and display outputs.

SO WHAT ABOUT BUGS, FEATURES, ENHANCEMENTS?

  It is possible that there will be issues, weather they be bugs or features
  that would like to be added.  You can do a couple of things, on fix/add the
  code yourself and send it to me.  This is the fastest way to get improvements
  into the code.  You can send me a note that has a discription of the problem
  and if possible the recreate setup.  I will see what I can do about getting
  these things added to the code.

  Comments are always welcome, even if it is just a note to let me know how
  well the tools is working for you.  I am also interested in comparing the
  tool to others that people have used.  I would be interested in any feedback
  about the usability, data output, functionality, etc. as compared to other
  tools.
