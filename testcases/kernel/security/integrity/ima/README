These testcases test the Integrity Measurement Architecture(IMA).

Requirements
------------

A kernel with IMA configured, mount with i_version support, openssl
and openssl-devel packages, and auditd, if enabled, with the integrity
patch, are required to build and run the IMA testsuite.

- Enabling IMA in .config will also enable CRYPTO, SECURITYFS, TCG_TPM,
  and TPM_TIS.

CONFIG_IMA=y
CONFIG_IMA_MEASURE_PCR_IDX=10
CONFIG_IMA_AUDIT=y
CONFIG_IMA_LSM_RULES=y

- Both sysfs and securityfs if not mounted, will be mounted.

- The testsuite must be executed with root priveleges so that it
  can access securityfs files, such as: security/ima/policy and
  security/ima/ascii_runtime_measurement.

- Both openssl and openssl-devel must be installed, to build the
  testsuite.  At runtime, if openssl is not installed, many of the
  tests will skipped.

- auditd, if enabled, requires the integrity patch, which is available
  from https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2009-March/msg00016.html.

- In order to re-measure a file after it changes, the file system must
  be mounted with i_version support(Bugzilla 471593).
  [util-linux-ng-2.14.2-2.fc11.src.rpm]

  Add 'iversion' in /etc/fstab as:
	dev/hdb1  	/home  	ext2  	defaults,iversion 	1 2

  To mount the root partition with i_version support, 'iversion' must
  be added on the remount line in /etc/rc.sysinit:
	# Remount the root filesystem read-write.
	update_boot_stage RCmountfs
	if remount_needed ; then
	  action $"Remounting root filesystem in read-write mode: " mount -n -o remount,rw,iversion /
	fi


Dependency
----------
The testsuite is dependent on the default policy being enabled, which
measures all executables, all files mmapped for execute and all files
open for read by root. If the default policy has been replaced, loading
another measurement policy will fail, as the policy may only be replaced
once per boot. Some of the policy dependency tests might also fail as well.

Run tests
---------
After doing 'make' and 'make install' from the top-level,
- execute './ltp-full-<version>/runltp -f ima' to run the entire testsuite.
- To run individual tests, cd into the IMA directory:
  ./ltp-full-<version>/testcases/kernel/security/integrity/ima/tests/
  and execute the individual scripts.

System State after running the Testsuite
----------------------------------------
After running the testsuite, the default measurement policy has been
replaced with an identical policy. If you want to install a different
policy, such as an LSM specific one, a reboot is required.
