mem01

	Test for exercising virtual memory allocation
        and usage. It is intended to provide a limited exposure of the
        system swapper, for now.

mtest01

        mallocs memory <chunksize> at a time until malloc fails.

mtest05/mmstress

	Performs General Stress with Race conditions

mtest06/mmap1

	Test the LINUX memory manager. The program is aimed at        
        stressing the memory manager by simultanious map/unmap/read   
        by light weight processes, the test is scheduled to run for   
        a mininum of 24 hours.

mtest06/mmap2

	Test the LINUX memory manager. The program is aimed at       
        stressing the memory manager by repeaded map/write/unmap of a 
        of a large gb size file.     

mtest06/mmap3

	Test the LINUX memory manager. The program is aimed at        
	stressing the memory manager by repeaded map/write/unmap      
	of file/memory of random size (maximum 1GB) this is done by
	multiple processes.	 

mtest06/shmat1

	Test the LINUX memory manager. The program is aimed at      
	stressing the memory manager by repeaded shmat/write/read/    
	shmatd of file/memory of random size (maximum 1000 * 4096)    
	done by multiple processes.
