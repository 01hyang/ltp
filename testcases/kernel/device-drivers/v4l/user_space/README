What is this?
-------------
v4l-test is a test environment for V4L2 drivers. The V4L2 drivers
are running under Linux in kernel space. This test environment is running
in userspace and tries what normal video application would do. It also
tries some things which are supposed to test the error handling mechanisms
of a V4L2 driver. These are the "invalid test cases".

The V4L2 API only covers webcams and analog tuner cards, the digital broadcast
is out of the scope of V4L2 API so it is also out of the scope of this test
environment. See Linux DVB API at http://linuxtv.org/docs/dvbapi/dvbapi.html
for digital broadcast and Chapter 6.3 "Relation of V4L2 to other Linux multimedia APIs"
in V4L2 specification.

How to build?
-------------
To build the test environment you will need a C compiler, "make" and the
CUnit development files installed. Just type "make" and the test environment
is ready.

How to run?
-----------
You need to have a video device (i.e. webcam, tuner card, etc.) connected
to your system and available under /dev/video0. If you don't have any
hardware device available, you can still test the "Virtual Video Driver".
To compile this you need to compile your kernel with CONFIG_VIDEO_VIVI=m
under:

  -> Device Drivers
    -> Multimedia devices
      -> Video For Linux
        -> Video capture adapters
         -> Virtual Video Driver

At this point you can execute v4l-test.

Video for Linux Two Specification
---------------------------------
The V4L2 API specification can be found at http://v4l2spec.bytesex.org/spec/ .
Revision 0.42 of V4L2 is the base for this test environment.

Code Coverage
-------------
The code coverage shows which lines of the code were executed and how many
times. The measurement results gives you a feedback about the quality of
the test cases.
You can measure the code coverage of a kernel module with the gocv and lcov
softwares. See http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/gcov.php and
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php for details.

Current status
--------------
Currently all test are running and evaluated automatically. This might
change in future if we want to test for example plugging and unplugging
a USB video device or ask the user if a received picture make sense or not.

See doc/index.html about how much of the specification is covered by the
different test cases.
