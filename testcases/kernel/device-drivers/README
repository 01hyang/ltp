- ACPI testcase -
        ACPI must be enabled in the kernel. Since ACPI will control devices and possibly put them to sleep,
        it's not recommended that any other tests be run concurrently with these tests since you may
        get unexpected results. 
        These tests are currently ONLY supported on the 2.5 kernels. 2.4 kernels probably won't even build much 
        less run.
        run ltpacpi.sh -r run  to execute the tests
