This document defines the coverage for the pthread_cancel function:

Assertion	Tested?
1		YES
2		YES ** Difficult to test and assert that date destructors
		       have been called (read assertions.xml file for more).
3		NO ** Difficult assertion, postponing it 'till a later time 
4		YES
5		YES

NOTE: In a lot of these test, I didn't make use of semaphores or mutexes, but
rather manually created my own.  This is because I was taking into account
different implementations.
