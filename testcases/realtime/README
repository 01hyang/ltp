realtime tests is an open-source testsuite for testing real-time Linux.  It is
licensed under the GPL.  The latest version of this testsuite is available
from http://rt.wiki.kernel.org.  This testsuite is maintained by the IBM
Real-Time team.  Please send bug reports, contributions, questions to
the discussion list also available at: http://rt.wiki.kernel.org.

The testsuite contains some functional tests and a few performance
and latency measurement tests.  This is still a work in (early) progress!


DEPENDENCIES
============
It is recommended that you have automake-1.9.6-2.1 or above.
If you see errors during your configure, please upgrade to
this version and autoconf-2.61.


BUILD
=====
As of April 2007, we include autoconf support (based on Robert
Schwebel's contributed patch). To build the tests:

1. ./configure
2. make


RUNNING THE TESTS
==================
The top level script run.sh can be used to invoke all or a subset of tests.

1. Running the script with no arguments will list usage:

        #]> run.sh


2. Running the script with the list option will list the available tests.

        #]> run.sh list

   Note that the tests available are determined by the presence
   of a local script run_auto.sh in the individual test subdirectories
   at this time.


3. Individual tests can also be run. For example, to run the prio-wake tests:

        #]> run.sh func/prio-wake

   Note, the test must be specified with the path relative to the test
   home (where run.sh lives).


4. Alternatively, you can run the individual tests from their local directory.
   For example, to run the prio-wake tests:

        #]> cd func/prio-wake
        #]> ./run_auto.sh


5. You can also run sets of tests:

        #]> run.sh func

        will run all the functional tests

        #]> run.sh perf

        will run all the perf tests (if any!)

        Use the list option to see the various arguments taken.

6. Or you can run the binaries...



RESULTS
=======
All the automated run scripts set up logging in the logs/ directory.  Not all
the tests have a clear PASS/FAIL outcome quite yet.  Work on parsing results
is ongoing.
