rt-test - HOWTO_ADD_TESTS
==========================

1. Select the appropriate bucket
	- func, stress, perf
	- under those, should it go into an existing
	  subdirectory?
	- note that only the top level subdirectory
	  (which has a run_auto.sh script) gets listed
	  individually as an available test.
	- run "run.sh list" to see available tests

2. If you are creating a new subdirectory:
   Provide:
	- your test files
	- your GNUMakefile.am
	- your run_auto.sh script (use template: doc/run_auto.sh.tpl)

3. Modify tests profiles if to be run automatically
	- profile/default
	- other profiles if needed

4. Test the following:
	sh autogen.sh; ./configure, make, naturally
	run.sh list
	run.sh clean
	run.sh subdir # entire bucket
	run.sh subdir/your_test_dir
	subdir/your_test_dir/run_auto.sh

5. Test source files:
	(Ideally...:))
	- your test source files have
		- a clear description of test purpose and criteria
		- author
		- license
		- requirements for set up, etc
	- your test has clear PASS/FAIL criteria if functional
	- your test logs some result
	- your test has a -h option which displays usage
