 * NAME
 *      libjvmsim.h
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      Provide threads to mimic real-time jvm activity
 *
 *      Note: this "library" is written as a single header file to simplify the
 *      creation of new test cases and keep the build system simple.  At some
 *      point it may make sense to break it up into .h and .c files and link to
 *      it as an object file.

 * USAGE:
 *      Compilation : To be included in testcases.
 *
 * AUTHOR
