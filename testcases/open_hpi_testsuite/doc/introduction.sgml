  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
The Service Availability Forum(SAF) Hardware Platform Interface (HPI) provides 
an industry  standard interface to monitor and control highly available 
telecommunications system  platforms. The ability to monitor and control 
these platforms is provided through a consistent  and standard set of 
programmatic interfaces that are targeted for adoption by the telecom  
building block industry to significantly reduce product time-to-market 
and development costs  while retaining or enhancing total system/network 
availability.   
  </para>
  <para>
HPI provides the interface between the middleware software solution stack 
and the  hardware solution stack, allowing portability of middleware 
software building blocks  across many different hardware platforms and 
portability of hardware platforms across  many different middleware 
software building blocks.

    <title>Purpose of this document</title>
    <para>
This test specification was written as part of the OpenHPI effort to create
a non-implementation biased test suite to expose where a given HPI
implementation does not conform with the SAF HPI specification.  This document
was created by studying the SAF publicly released documents that pertain
to HPI, and is not affiliated with the SAF.
    </para>
    <para>
With that said, it is the goal of this test specification (and therefore any
test suites that follow this test specification) to accurately depict HPI as
envisioned by the SAF.  Any feedback from the SAF on areas where we have failed
to meet this goal will be treated as a priority one item to fix.

Specifically, the purpose of this document is to: 
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
Provide the framework for SAF HPI conformance testing activities so that it is 
clear  what will be tested in each stage of testing, who will perform the 
testing activities, how the  testing activities will be performed and the 
sequence of the test activities. 
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
Define the scope of the conformance testing for SAF HPI.
