crash01

	A signal handler is set up so that in most cases the machine exception
	generated by the illegal instructions, bad operands, etc in the procedure
	made up of random data are caught; and another round of randomness may
	be tried. Eventually a random instruction may corrupt the program or
	the machine state in such a way that the program must halt. This is
	a test of the robustness of the hardware/software for instruction
	fault handling.
	
	Note: Running this program just a few times, using total CPU time of
	less than a few seconds SHOULD NOT GIVE YOU ANY CONFIDENCE in system
	robustness. Having it run for hours, with tens of thousands of cases
	would be a different thing. It would also make sense to run this
	stress test at the same time you run other tests, like a multi-user
	benchmark.

	CAUTION: running this program may crash your system, your disk and all
        	your data along! DO NOT RUN IT ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!

Disktest 

	Does repeated accesses to a filespec and optionally writes to, reads from,
       	and  verifies  the  data.  By default, disktest makes assumptions about the running
       	environment which allows for a quick start of IO generation.  However, Disktest has
       	a  large  number  of command line options which can be used to adapt the test for a
       	variety of uses including data integraty, medium integraty, perforamance, and  sim-
       	ple application simulation.

f00f

	This is a simple test for handling of the pentium f00f bug.
	It is an example of a catistrophic test case.  If the system
	doesn't correctly handle this test, it will likely lockup.
