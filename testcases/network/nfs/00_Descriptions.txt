nfs01

	 Stresses NFS by opening a large number of files on a nfs
         mounted filesystem.

nfs02

	Tests NFS copy of various filesizes, file consistency between copies
        and preservation of write/nowrite permissions.

nfslock01

	Two processes open FLOCK_IDATA file simultaneously
        each one locks odd and even lines of the file simultaneously
        and fill them with '0's and '1's. After they find eof, the
        datafiles are compared.

nfsstat01

	 Tests the 'nfsstat' command.  This test runs locally, so no
         actual network connection is needed.
