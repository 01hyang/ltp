Overview: 
    Name:           fs_perms
    Description:    A regression test for unix rwx permissions 
                    that allows the user to create a list of files
                    as someuser/somegroup, set the file 
                    permissions mode and test those permissions as
                    anotheruser/anothergroup.  The idea is to 
                    verify filesystem permissions on various new 
                    (or old) filesystems.

    fs_perms.c

Availability:
    Currently only available via internal IBM websites pending 
    legal review:
    http://cvs.opensource.ibm.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/testcases/fs/fs_perms/?cvsroot=ltp

Installation:
    Unzip/Untar files.
    make all 
                        
Use:
    Create as many test user accounts and groups as you think you
    will need if you don't want to use existing accounts.

    [Octal Mode] [File Owner's UID] [File Owner's GID] [Test User's UID] [Test User's GID] [r|w|x] [Expected Result 0|1]

    (ex.) If you wanted someuser in nobody's group to test group 
    permissions on a file owned by nobody.nobody you would want a
    command line like the following:
    ./fs_perms 020 99 99 200 99 w 1

Warning(s):
    This program does ZERO data validation!  Be very careful that
    you don't include any extra white space in your conf file!
    Remember that ownership and permissions of the current 
    directory may affect your test results.

ToDo:

    Add some data validation.

ChangeLog:
    Date      Version       Author                  Reason
    04/12/01    .99         martinjn@us.ibm.com     Needed permissions regression test and couldn't
                                                    find a "REAL" programmer to write it for me.
    04/19/01   1.0          martinjn@us.ibm.com     Added test for execute bit and README.
    05/23/01   1.1          martinjn@us.ibm.com     Added command line parameter to specify test file.
    07/12/01   1.2          martinjn@us.ibm.com     Removed need for config file.  All parameters are passed 
                                                    from command line.  These changes were made to allow 
                                                    fs_perms to work with our test harness.
