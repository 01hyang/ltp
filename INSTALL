Building and Installation of Test Tools.

At the time of release, simplicity of the released code was considered
paramount to understanding and adoption.  For this reason no effort was
put into engineering complicated and convoluted build processes that
were not necessary.  Instead, a minimal approach was taken and the
build process reflects that.  Simply:

make

This does two things, builds the test libraries and then the tests.
