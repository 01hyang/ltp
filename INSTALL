Detailed Installation
---------------------

Beyond the "Quick Start" instructions, there are only a few other things
that should be done.  The Linux Test Project build process uses a
minimalist approach.  There is a lot of room for improvement and
contributions are welcome.

1. Untar the ltp tarball into a spare directory.  There is not a
   standard location for it yet.  We put it in out home directory
   while we're working on it.  

2. Run "make" to build everything.  

3. Some tests need to run as "root" and will fail if they are not run as
   root.  We have decided to use super[1] to change to root when tests
   need to.  Super doesn't require a password and is safer than
   installing test cases setuid.  Add the following line to your
   /etc/super.tab and edit it to match your user and where you installed
   LTP.  See super(5) for details.

{mknod01,setgroups01,setuid02,unlink08} /home/tester/ltp/tests/* tester uid=0

   There are some tests that require root, others that behave differently
   as root, and others that shouldn't be run as root.  Any tests that you
   want to run as root should be added to your /etc/super.tab.  

4. You can run all of the tests sequentially by using the example test
   script runalltests.sh.  The script is there just to get you started.
   See pan(1) for more information on the test driver we have provided.
   It is simple, but it can do a lot of stuff.
