Detailed Installation
---------------------

Beyond the "Quick Start" instructions, there are only a few other things
that should be done.  The Linux Test Project build process uses a
minimalist approach.  There is a lot of room for improvement and
contributions are welcome.

1. Log in as root.

2. Untar the ltp tarball into a spare directory.  There is not a
   standard location for it yet.  We put it in out home directory
   while we're working on it.  

3. Run "make" to build everything.  


4. You can run all of the tests sequentially by using the example test
   script runalltests.sh.  The script is there just to get you started.
   See pan(1) for more information on the test driver we have provided.
   It is simple, but it can do a lot of stuff. 

NOTE: The diskio and network tests will NOT be run by the runalltests.sh 
script.  We chose to seperate these tests because of there required setup
overhead.
