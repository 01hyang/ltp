Building and Installation of Test Tools.

At the time of release, simplicity of the released code was considered
paramount to understanding and adoption.  For this reason no effort was
put into engineering complicated and convoluted build processes that
were not necessary.  Instead, a minimal approach was taken and the
build process reflects that.  Simply:

cd <tool>
make

At the time of release, <tool> is one of doio or pan.  The build process
builds the tools in question and leaves them among the sources.  There
are no install routines, yet.
