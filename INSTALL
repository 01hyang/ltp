Detailed Installation
---------------------

Beyond the "Quick Start" instructions, there are only a few other things
that should be done.  The Linux Test Project build process uses a
minimalist approach.  There is a lot of room for improvement and
contributions are welcome.

1. Untar the ltp tarball into a spare directory.  There is not a
   standard location for it yet.  We put it in out home directory
   while we're working on it.  

2. Run "make" to build everything.  

3. Some tests need to run as "root" and will fail if they are not run as
   root.  There are several programs that will do this for you.  We have
   supplied sample config files for sudo[1] and super[2] in
   doc/examples.  Please see the related sudoers(5) and super.tab(5) man
   pages for more information on setting up these programs.

   The tests that require these programs have been split into separate
   pan files.  Add these to your working pan file once you have your
   system configured properly.

4. You can run all of the tests sequentially by using the example test
   script runalltests.sh.  The script is there just to get you started.
   See pan(1) for more information on the test driver we have provided.
   It is simple, but it can do a lot of stuff.
