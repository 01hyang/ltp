About the Linux Test Project

The Linux Test Project is a joint project with SGI, IBM, OSDL, and Bull with a
goal to deliver test suites to the open source community that validate the
reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. The Linux Test Project is a
collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features. Our goal
is to improve the Linux kernel by bringing test automation to the kernel testing
effort. Interested open source contributors are encouraged to join the project.


In the Package
--------------
Here is a short description of what is included in this package

INSTALL
	Installation documentation and quick start guide

README
	This document

CREDITS
	Credits to those who have contributed to the project.

COPYING
		 GNU General Public License

ChangeLog
	An incomplete list of changes to the project.  We will try harder to
	keep this up to date.

Makefile
		 Top level make file for LTP.

runalltests.sh
	A simple script to run all of the packaged tests in sequential order and
		 report the overall result.

diskio.sh
	A simple script to run all the diskio tests that pertain to the CD-ROM
	and floppy disk file systems.

networktests.sh
	A simple script to run all the network related tests that require
	another remote machine.

doc/*
	Documentation for the project including man pages for some of the
	tools & library functions, as well as descriptions of every test.


include/*
lib/*
	The include and lib directories contain headers and codes for common
	routines used by many of the tests.  We have tried to keep this to a
		 minimum.

testcases/*
	Contains all tests that run under the LTP as well as the "bin"
		 directory, which has hardlinks to all the test executables.

runtest/*
	It houses command lists that are used by pan for automated testing.

pan/*
	The pan directory contains a simple, lightweight test harness.  pan
	has the ability to run tests randomly and in parallel.  See pan's man
	page for more information.

scratch/*
	The scratch directory is a dumping ground for snippets and test cases
	that we found but haven't integrated into LTP yet.  Feel free to suggest
	new snippets to be added, or take one of these and finish it off.

testcases/kernel/containers/*
	Contains all the testcases related to container functionality ( e.g: sysvipc, utsname etc..)
	For further information on the each of the container functionality refer
	the following file: testcases/kernel/containers/README


Warning!
--------
Be careful with these tests!

Don't run them on production systems.  Growfiles, doio, and iogen in particular
stress the I/O capabilities of systems and while they should not cause problems
on properly functioning systems, they are intended to find (or cause) problems.

Enable CODE COVERAGE for your Kernel:
---------------------------------
1) Apply kernel-gcov patch(s) against the corresponding Kernel. They are available here:
http://ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ltp/utils/analysis/gcov-kernel/linux-2.*.*-gcov.patch?view=log,
2) Also enable the following options in your .config file before building the kernel
CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE=y
CONFIG_GCOV_ALL=y
CONFIG_GCOV_PROC=m
CONFIG_GCOV_HAMMER=y
