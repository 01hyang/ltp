Disktest

        Does repeated accesses to a filespec and optionally writes to, reads from,
        and  verifies  the  data.  By default, disktest makes assumptions about 
        the running environment which allows for a quick start of IO generation.  
	However, Disktest has  a  large  number  of command line options which can 
        be used to adapt the test for a variety of uses including data integrity, 
	medium integraty, performance, and  simple application simulation.


stress_cd

	Creates multiple read threads on the cdrom device.
