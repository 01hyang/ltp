sem01

	Creates a semaphore and two processes.  The processes
        each go through a loop where they semdown, delay for a
        random amount of time, and semup, so they will almost
        always be fighting for control of the semaphore.

sem02
	The application creates several threads using pthread_create().
	One thread performs a semop() with the SEM_UNDO flag set. The
	change in sempaphore value performed by that semop should be
	"undone" only when the last pthread exits.
