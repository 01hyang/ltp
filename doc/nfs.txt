nfs01

	Stresses NFS by opening a large number of files on a nfs
        mounted filesystem.

nfs02

	Tests NFS copy of various filesizes, file consistency between copies
        and preservation of write/nowrite permissions.

nfs03
	Runs the LTP filesystem test: fs_inod, on an NFS mountpoint.	


nfslock01

	Two processes open FLOCK_IDATA file simultaneously
        each one locks odd and even lines of the file simultaneously
        and fill them with '0's and '1's. After they find eof, the
        datafiles are compared.

nfsstat01

	 Tests the 'nfsstat' command.  This test runs locally, so no
         actual network connection is needed.

nfsstress 

	This program is designed stress the NFS implimentation.       
	Many bugs were uncovered in the AIX operating system          
	implimentation of NFS when AIX kernel was built over NFS.     
	Source directory on a remote machine (one server many clients)
	NFS-mounted on to a directory on a local machine from which   
	the kernel build was initiated. Apparently many defects/bugs  
	were uncovered when multiple users tried to build the kernel  
	by NFS mounting the kernel source from a remote machine and   
	tried to build the kernel on a local machine. AIX build envi- 
	ronment is set up to create the object files and executable   
	on the local machine. 					      
	This testcase will try to recreate such a senario.            
	Spawn N number of threads. Each thread does the following.    
	* Create a directory tree.                                    
	* Populate it with ".c" files and makefiles.                  
	* initate a build. Executable will print hello world when executed
	* clean up all the executables that were created.             
	* recurssively remove each subdir and its contents.           
	The test is aimed at stressing the NFS client and server.
