- Change to 1024 default if IO_BITMAP_BITS not defined
- Applied fix for conditions where ENOMEM test scenarios were failing.
- mlockall03 is a Test for checking basic error conditions for mlockall(2)
  starting from linux 2.6.9
- NGROUPS_MAX defined in limits.h is not the max number of groups in the
  system, it the max number guaranteed.  Thus, if the system actually
  allows more, the test case doesn't produce the expected failure.
- test3 in setrlimit02.c:Test attempts to increase hard limit of RLIMIT_NOFILE resource.
  The rlim_max used by setrlimit() is expected to be greater than current hard limit to get EPERM.
- nfsstress - Corrected so the test can find gettid()'s definition.

- New test creates a data file of specified or random size and copies
  the file to a random directory depth on a designated filesystem.
  The two files are compared and checked for differences.

- Moved SELinux testsuite from misc to the kernel/security directory.

- ioperm01 - Fixed bug will cause ioperm01 receive SEGV and report "BROK" instead of "FAIL" when this test failed.
- nfs04 - use 'cmp' instead of 'diff' because I think byte comparison is better for the type of file created for this test.
- Fixed ftp01 and telnet01 seems designed to run with non-root user connection
  when the user name is set to RUSER environment variable.
  However, it is incomplete.ftp01 creates a directory whose permission is root.
  So, non-root user cannot write in the directory.
  telnet01 always consider the prompt is '#'

  Blackfin processor, we found a problem in mount01 where malloc was not
  reserving space for the trailing null byte and strncpy was being called
  without enough bytes to account for the trailing null byte.  The
  following patch fixes the problem
- Increased USER_PRECISION to 2200 to take into account the processes switching time nanosleep02
- The attached patch fixes a swapon cross compile build error I ran into
  recently. I verified that RH9 self hosted and cross compile builds now

  can build and execute the test without it now.
- Change for defect 13778, when the /var/log/messages file is first moved, the first write fails
- The SIGINT sighandler will set the "intinitr" flag to 1 for the children. But if the
  "runtime" is small( a command line argument passed, the testcases were running
  for 5 secs here), it may happen that the SIGINT may be recieved before the
  child initialize the flag to 0, and which may lead to a hang
- Change to exclude lib6 directory from default build since it breaks earlier Distros
- Added code to handle cases where certain distros don't define AI_V4MAPPED in /usr/include/netdb.h

- Fix getrlimit02.  Rajeev Tiwari <rajeevti@in.ibm.com> pointed out that RLIMIT_NLIMIT was now too 
  low in the usr include files for newer kernels to cause this to fail.  Defined a new high one that 
  ought to work for the forseeable future.
