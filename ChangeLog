o	simplified telnet01 when looking for root prompt
o	removed incorrect testcase from sendfile03
o	fixed modify_ldt01 test problems on newer kernels

LTP-20010925
------------
o	Testcases have been organized into categories in a directory 
	structure under the testcases subdirectory
o	About 400 new testcases added covering various system calls
o	Andreas Jaeger got confirmation from the glibc people that the
	ulimit test was broken as a result of some changes made in 
	glibc2.2.5.  Since it's the test that's broken, Nate Straz 
	removed the offending testcase.
o	Updated README and INSTALL files
o	Descriptions of the testcases have been added to the doc 
	directory and are organized by type (syscalls.txt, fs.txt, etc.)
