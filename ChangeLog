	copies are run simultaneously
o	workaround for SIGTTOU hang in ioctl02
o	shmget03 uses IPC_PRIVATE to make it safe when running multiple copies

o	Many improvements to mtest05 and mtest06 tests
o	new test nfsstress
o	included ver_linux in LTP and made it run at the end of test scripts
o	check for necessary users/groups in Makefile and warn if they don't
	exist

LTP-20010925
------------
o	Testcases have been organized into categories in a directory 
	structure under the testcases subdirectory
o	About 400 new testcases added covering various system calls
o	Andreas Jaeger got confirmation from the glibc people that the
	ulimit test was broken as a result of some changes made in
