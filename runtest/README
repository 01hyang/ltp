runtests -- a simple test running framework

synopsis

runtests.py [cmdlist [...]]

Format of the Command List
--------------------------

The format of the command list looks something like this:
test_alarm01 alarm01
test_alarm02 alarm02

Each line refers to a specific test.  The first token is a
unique identifier for the test.  Subsequent tokens form the
command line executed.

Running a set of tests
----------------------

The command list or lists contains a list of commands to
run.  An example invocation looks something like this:

$ ./runtests.py cmdlist
test_alarm01: running cmdline 'alarm01'
test_alarm01: stdout:
alarm01     1  PASS  :  alarm(1) returned 0
test_alarm01: result: PASS
test_alarm02: running cmdline 'alarm02'
test_alarm02: stdout:
alarm02     1  PASS  :  alarm(4294967295) returned 0 as expected for value -1.
alarm02     2  PASS  :  alarm(4294967295) returned 0 as expected for value ULONG_MAX.
alarm02     3  PASS  :  alarm(0) returned 0 as expected for value ULONG_MAX+1.
test_alarm02: result: PASS

Here you can see that test_alarm01 and test_alarm02 were executed.

If any of the tests failed, the exit status of the runtests.py
command will be non-zero.  Otherwise, the exit status will be zero.
