TODO:
 - The CLI ops need to be improved to allow specification of a
particular test id to be run. Example: runtests.py -t test_alarm01
cmdlist quickhit.list
 - PATH needs to be set to include the location of all the tests before
running the harness.
 - No multi-process support
 - needs some randomization
 - no configuration analysis capability
